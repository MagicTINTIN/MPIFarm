\section{Non-linear equation system : Quasi-Newton}
Then I had to solve the system of non-linear equation below using Quasi-Newton method.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        x_2 sin (\frac{x_1}{2}) - 0.1 = 0 \hspace{1cm}(Z1)\\
        x_1^2 + (\frac{x_2}{4})^4 - 12 = 0 \hspace{1cm}(Z2)
\end{cases}\,
\end{equation}
First, we can plot the surfaces of the two equations, Z1 and Z2.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{images/surfacesrepresntations.png}
    \caption{Z1 (blue) and Z2 (red) surfaces}
    \label{fig:surfacesplots}
\end{figure}
The lines represent the values in which the equation is equal to 0.\\
Then we can plot the intersections of the two surfaces, and even the intersections of the lines, which will give us the solutions graphically.

\end{figure}

To code the Quasi-Newton algorithm, we will need the function and its Jacobian matrix (obtained with approximations of the partial derivates of the function).\\
\input{Parts/code/nonlineardefs.tex}
The Quasi-Newton algorithm takes as argument an initial point (with two coordinates in our case), and do several iterations to make this point converge to a root.\\
\input{Parts/code/quasinewton.tex}
Finally, to find all the roots we make a whole set of points (in my case I made a grid of 16 points distributed on our surface of interest (-10 to 10 for the two axis))\\
\input{Parts/code/mapofpoints.tex}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/nldistribution.png}
    \caption{Set of distributed points on which Quasi-Newton will be applied}
    \label{fig:nldistri}
\end{figure}
Then we start Quasi-Newton method on every point and see where they converge.
\input{Parts/code/nlexecute.tex}
So finally we obtain the approximated coordinates of the 4 solutions:\\
\begin{resultbox}
    Average number of steps per point: 30.64\\
    Solutions of the non-linear equation are : \\
    $[[-0.026865460174149012, -7.4447269258435576],$\\
    $[-3.4641015557326065, -0.10131438702733254],$\\
    $[3.4641015559745827, 0.10131438728799054],$\\
    $[0.026865460174157533, 7.444726925845088]]$
\end{resultbox}

To verify the results, I used the website \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com/}.
